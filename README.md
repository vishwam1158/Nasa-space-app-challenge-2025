# Agro Orbit NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 🌍

## **Project: NASA Farm Navigators 🌱**
**Tagline:** *Your Farm, Guided by the Stars!*  
**Created by:** Agro Orbit  
**For:** NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

---

### 🧩 Overview
**NASA Farm Navigators** is an engaging educational game for Android that makes NASA's satellite data simple and accessible.  
Players manage a **virtual farm** using **real-world NASA datasets** to learn sustainable, data-driven agriculture.

---

## 🛰️ The Challenge: Bridging the Gap
NASA's Earth observation satellites generate massive amounts of data on climate, soil moisture, and vegetation health.  
However, this **complex scientific data** is often hard to understand for students, educators, and farmers.

👉 Our project addresses the **“Sowing Solutions: A Farming Simulation Game”** challenge by translating this data into actionable learning.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: Learn, then Play!
Farm Navigators combines **education and simulation** with its philosophy: *"Learn, then Play."*

### **1️⃣ The Learning Hub 🚀**
An interactive, in-game module that explains NASA data concepts in simple language.

Each topic includes:
- **What it is:** A simple definition (e.g., *What is NDVI?*)
- **How NASA measures it:** Missions like *MODIS* or *SMAP*
- **A Real Indian Case Study:** Localized examples, e.g., *NDVI used to track locust swarms in Gujarat*

### **2️⃣ The Simulation Game 🌾**
Players apply what they learn in a realistic simulation.

Gameplay steps:
1. **Select a Location:** Choose a region (e.g., Gujarat, India or California, USA)
2. **Analyze Data:** Use a "mission control" dashboard powered by real NASA concepts
3. **Face Challenges:** Droughts, heatwaves, floods — based on real-world data
4. **Make Decisions:** Invest in irrigation, pest control, or drainage
5. **See Outcomes:** Learn through profit/loss feedback based on your strategy
