NASA Farm Navigators üå±
Your Farm, Guided by the Stars!
A project by Agro Orbit for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025.

NASA Farm Navigators is an engaging educational game for Android that makes the power of NASA's satellite data simple and accessible for everyone. It allows players to manage a virtual farm, facing real-world scenarios based on actual NASA datasets to learn the fundamentals of sustainable, data-driven agriculture.



üõ∞Ô∏è The Challenge: Bridging the Gap
NASA's Earth observation satellites provide a treasure trove of data on climate, soil moisture, and vegetation health. However, this complex scientific data is often inaccessible and difficult to understand for students, educators, and small-scale farmers. There is a significant knowledge gap that prevents this valuable information from being used in practical, on-ground decision-making.

Our project directly addresses the "Sowing Solutions: A Farming Simulation Game" challenge.

üí° Our Solution: Learn, then Play!
Farm Navigators is a simulation game built with a core philosophy: "Learn, then Play." We bridge the gap between data and action through two main features:

1. The Learning Hub üöÄ
Before starting the game, users are encouraged to visit the Learning Hub. This is a built-in educational module that explains the core NASA data concepts in simple terms. Each topic includes:

What it is: A simple definition (e.g., "What is NDVI?").

How NASA measures it: The specific mission or instrument involved (e.g., MODIS, SMAP).

A real Indian Case Study: Grounding the data in a local, relatable context (e.g., using NDVI to track locust swarms in Gujarat).

2. The Simulation Game üåæ
Once prepared, players apply their knowledge in the game:

Select a Location: Choose a real-world region (like Gujarat, India or California, USA) and a season.

Analyze the Data: Receive a simplified "mission control" dashboard with key metrics based on real NASA data concepts for that specific scenario.

Face a Challenge: Encounter realistic challenges like droughts, heatwaves, or flood risks, which are triggered by the data.

Make a Decision: Use your starting capital to invest in solutions like irrigation, pest control, or drainage.

See the Outcome: At the end of the season, see the direct financial impact of your decisions, learning whether your strategy led to a profit or a loss.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive Simulation: A hands-on, risk-free environment to learn farming principles.

Real-world Scenarios: Challenges are based on genuine climate patterns in different parts of the world.

Integrated Learning Hub: Seamlessly blended education to empower players before they play.

Localized Indian Case Studies: Making global data relevant to a local context.

Simple Financial Model: Teaches the economic consequences of agricultural decisions.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools
This is a fully native Android application built with a modern technology stack:

Language: Kotlin

UI Toolkit: Jetpack Compose

Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with StateFlow

NASA Data Integration
While this is a simulation, the scenarios and data points are directly inspired by and designed to teach the principles of several key NASA datasets:

MODIS: Used as the basis for the NDVI (Vegetation Index) and LST (Land Surface Temperature) metrics, which determine crop health and heat stress in the game.

SMAP: The core inspiration for our Soil Moisture data, which is a critical factor for irrigation decisions and drought challenges.

GPM: The concepts from this mission are used to simulate the Precipitation data, driving our monsoon and flood-risk scenarios.

VIIRS: The active fire data from VIIRS inspired the high-stakes wildfire risk challenge in the California scenario.

üöÄ Getting Started
To run this project:

Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/your-username/farm-navigators.git

Open the project in the latest version of Android Studio.

Let Gradle sync and download the required dependencies.

Run the app on an Android emulator or a physical device.

üîÆ Future Vision
This is just the beginning! My vision for Farm Navigators is to expand it to:

Connect to More APIs: Integrate real-time data from NASA APIs for dynamic, up-to-date scenarios.
More Regions & Crops: Add more diverse agricultural zones from around the world, each with unique crops and challenges.

Advanced Economic Factors: Introduce more complex market dynamics, supply chains, and government subsidies.
